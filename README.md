Coding Challenges & Exercises
=============================

###### Every file starts out with a commented section explaining/describing the problem and the expected result/solution.

**Solving, Refactoring, & Implementing ES6**
  1. Solve all problems with basic vanilla javascript
  2. Refactor & Rewrite all code. Incorporating all what I have been learning.
     Also going to try and solve all problems dynamically and with as little code
     as possible.
  3. Convert final code to ES6


**I am Teachable, Determined, & Joyful**
  + I am also open to ideas & would love feed back on my code.
  + As you can see I am also an __New Born Coder__ & would also love some pointers as to what I should learn/work on next.
