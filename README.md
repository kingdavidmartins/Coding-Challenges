Coding Challenges & Exercises
=============================

###### Every file starts out with a commented section explaining/describing the problem and the expected result/solution.

**Solving, Refactoring, & Implementing ES6**
  1. Solve all problems with basic vanilla javascript :heavy_check_mark: :100: :heavy_exclamation_mark: :bowtie: :eyeglasses:
  2. Refactor & Rewrite all code. Incorporating all what I have been learning.
     Also going to try and solve all problems dynamically and with as little code
     as possible. Functional Programming
  3. Convert final code to ES6
  4. Create New Folders & use Lodash.js instead of Native methods to solve the  Challenges
  5. Comment code.  


**I am Teachable, Determined, & Joyful**
  + I am also open to ideas & would love feed back on my code.
  + As you can see I am also an __New Born Coder__ & would also love some pointers as to what I should learn/work on next.
